## Archetype: index_list

## Layout
- type: scrollable_column
- padding: default
- alignment: start

## Composition (top → bottom)
1. **text** (#products_title) — label: "Products", content: "Products"
2. **card** (#products_bank_selector) — label: "Bank selector", content: "Bank selector"
3. **tab_bar** (#products_scope_tabs) — label: "Product audience tabs"
4. **text** (#products_tab_personal) — label: "Personal", content: "Personal"
5. **text** (#products_tab_business) — label: "Business", content: "Business"
6. **card** (#product_card) — label: "Product", content: "Product"
7. **badge** (#product_category_badge) — label: "Category", content: "Category"
8. **text** (#product_more_info) — label: "More info", content: "More info"
9. **text** (#products_bank_load_failed) — label: "Could not load this bank's products", content: "Could not load this bank's products"
10. **text** (#products_scope_empty) — label: "No products at this bank yet", content: "No products at this bank yet"

## State-specific behavior
- Show an error illustration, a short message, and a single Retry action. No content rails visible.

## Content source manifest
- (no demo collections bound for this state)

## Components (vocabulary used in this prompt)
- (no named components extracted — see composition)

## Shell (app-shell resolved for this state)
- App-shell rules are defined per project; per-screen overrides are merged in.
- Render MUST keep nav/bar elements consistent with the resolved shell — present or absent, never partial.

## Tokens (design-tokens roles consumed)
- Colors: primary / secondary / surface / on-surface / on-surface-variant / error (M3 standard roles).
- Typography: body-large / title-large (M3 standard roles).
- Spacing: gap.sm / gap.md / gap.lg.
- ALL token references are by name from the uploaded design system — no hex literals, no inline size values.

## Self-Validation Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before returning the rendered mockup, verify ALL of these are true. If any fails, FIX the output and re-render.

- [ ] **Per-state shape:** the render shows ONLY this state ("error"). Do not blend multiple states into one mockup.
- [ ] **Real content:** every text label, image, and data point reflects the content source manifest above — no numbered generic items, no filler text, no dummy text, no empty strings.
- [ ] **Token fidelity:** colors come from the uploaded design system (primary/secondary/surface/etc.) by name; spacing comes from declared scale tokens. No invented hex codes, no invented size literals.
- [ ] **Component vocabulary:** every component in the render maps to a named design-system component (Card, FAB, BottomBar, etc.) — no invented or off-system components.
- [ ] **Archetype honored:** the layout follows the "index_list" archetype skeleton — composition order top → bottom matches the Composition section.
- [ ] **App-shell parity:** if a bottom nav, top app bar, or FAB appears in the render, it matches the resolved shell from the app-shell config. Shell elements are either present-and-consistent OR absent — never partial.

If any of these fail and the fix isn't clear → halt rendering and surface "Self-validation failed at: {checkpoint}."

Return ONLY when all 6 checkpoints pass.
