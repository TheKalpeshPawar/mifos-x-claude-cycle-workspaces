# scheduled-payments — content state

> Auto-generated from screens/scheduled-payments/ui.yaml @ SHA 86c86ea84d0aaa2f
> Stitch DesignSystem: (pending DESIGN.md upload — run /idea-feature-stitch sub-plan 02)
> DO NOT redeclare colors / fonts / spacing — they live in DESIGN.md.

> DO NOT invent navigation, tabs, or screens beyond the declared app-shell (Home, Accounts, Pay, More) plus the composition below. Every nav item you render MUST come from that list.
> Only elements that navigate or perform an action may look tappable (cursor, ripple, pressed state). DO NOT add tap affordances to decorative content — page titles, section headings, avatars, standalone icons, badges, and static labels are NOT interactive.

## Archetype: index_list

## Layout
- type: scrollable_column
- padding: default
- alignment: start
- responsive: any multi-column region MUST be mobile-first and collapse to a single column at narrow/phone widths — never a fixed multi-column grid with no single-column fallback.

## Composition (top → bottom)
1. **progress_indicator**
2. **icon_button** (#back_button) — icon: "arrow_back", on_click: { action: navigate_back, target: account-detail }
3. **list** (#scheduled_payments_list) — "scheduled_payments_list"
   - **card** (#scheduled_payment_card) — "scheduled_payment_card"
      - **text** (#sp_payee_name)
      - **text** (#sp_amount)
      - **text** (#sp_scheduled_date)
      - **chip** (#sp_type_chip) — label: "{item.scheduledTypeLabel}", icon: "{item.scheduledTypeIcon}"
      - **text** (#sp_account_id)
      - **text** (#sp_reference)
4. **empty_state** (#empty_scheduled_payments) — title: "{strings.sp_empty_title}", icon: "schedule"
5. **empty_state** (#unsupported_scheduled_payments) — title: "{strings.sp_unsupported_title}", icon: "info_outline"
6. **empty_state** (#error_state) — "{strings.sp_error_title}"
   - **button** (#retry_button) — label: "{strings.action_retry}", on_click: { action: retry_load }

## State-specific behavior
- Fully populated with the real demo content listed below.

## Content source manifest
- (no demo collections bound for this state)

## Components (vocabulary used in this prompt)
- (no named components extracted — see composition)

## Shell (app-shell resolved for this state)
- Home: navigates to home
- Accounts: navigates to accounts
- Pay: navigates to send-money
- More: navigates to settings
- Render MUST keep nav/bar elements consistent with the list above — present or absent, never partial.

## Tokens (design-tokens roles consumed)
- Colors: primary / secondary / surface / on-surface / on-surface-variant / error (M3 standard roles).
- Typography: body-large / title-large (M3 standard roles).
- Spacing: gap.sm / gap.md / gap.lg.
- ALL token references are by name from the uploaded design system — no hex literals, no inline size values.

## Self-Validation Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before returning the rendered mockup, verify ALL of these are true. If any fails, FIX the output and re-render.

- [ ] **Per-state shape:** the render shows ONLY this state ("content"). Do not blend multiple states into one mockup.
- [ ] **Real content:** every text label, image, and data point reflects the content source manifest above — no numbered generic items, no filler text, no dummy text, no empty strings.
- [ ] **Token fidelity:** colors come from the uploaded design system (primary/secondary/surface/etc.) by name; spacing comes from declared scale tokens. No invented hex codes, no invented size literals.
- [ ] **Component vocabulary:** every component in the render maps to a named design-system component (Card, FAB, BottomBar, etc.) — no invented or off-system components.
- [ ] **Archetype honored:** the layout follows the "index_list" archetype skeleton — composition order top → bottom matches the Composition section.
- [ ] **App-shell parity:** if a bottom nav, top app bar, or FAB appears in the render, it matches the resolved shell from the app-shell config. Shell elements are either present-and-consistent OR absent — never partial.

If any of these fail and the fix isn't clear → halt rendering and surface "Self-validation failed at: {checkpoint}."

Return ONLY when all 6 checkpoints pass.
