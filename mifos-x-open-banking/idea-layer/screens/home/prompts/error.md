Design the error state of the home screen for **Mifos X Open Banking**, a Open Banking KMP super-app for consumer retail banking and field officer agent banking in emerging markets.

Palette: primary #B2D188, on_primary #1F3701, primary_container #354E16, on_primary_container #CDEDA3, secondary #A0CFCB, on_secondary #003735, secondary_container #1F4E4B, error #FFB4AB, background #12140E, on_surface #E3E3D8, on_surface_variant #C5C8BA, surface_container #1E201A, outline #8F9285, pending #E8A317.

**Component 1 — App Bar** (full width, 56dp tall): Title "Home" Outfit Medium 18sp #E3E3D8 centered. Background #12140E. Zero elevation.

**Component 2 — Hero** (centered, top margin 64dp): 160dp x 160dp illustration of a broken bank vault or disconnected network rendered in #44483D and #8F9285 tones on #12140E. error_state archetype.

**Component 3 — App Bar** (centered, top margin 24dp, horizontal padding 32dp): Title "Couldn't load your accounts" Outfit SemiBold 22sp #E3E3D8 centered, max 2 lines.

**Component 4 — List Row** (centered, top margin 8dp, horizontal padding 48dp): Subtext "Check your connection and try again. Your account data will be back as soon as you reconnect." Outfit Regular 14sp #C5C8BA centered line-height 20sp max 25 words.

**Component 5 — Button** (full width minus 64dp insets, top margin 32dp): Filled pill button 48dp tall, 999dp corner radius, background #B2D188, leading refresh icon 20dp #1F3701, label "Retry" Outfit SemiBold 16sp #1F3701.

**Component 6 — Button** (centered, top margin 16dp): Text button "Go back" Outfit Medium 14sp #8F9285, no background, no icon.

Do not use em-dash anywhere in text. Do not make any headline more than 3 lines or any subtitle more than 25 words. Do not break the page theme between sections. Do not place light text on light buttons or dark text on dark buttons.

Centered layout on #12140E with generous vertical breathing room. The earth-green #B2D188 retry button keeps the error state reassuring rather than alarming, preserving trust in a regulated financial context.

## State-specific behavior
- Show an error illustration, a short message, and a single Retry action. No content rails visible.

## Content source manifest
- (no demo collections bound for this state)

## Components (vocabulary used in this prompt)
- (no named components extracted — see composition)

## Shell (app-shell resolved for this state)
- App-shell rules are defined per project; per-screen overrides are merged in.
- Render MUST keep nav/bar elements consistent with the resolved shell — present or absent, never partial.

## Tokens (design-tokens roles consumed)
- Colors: primary / secondary / surface / on-surface / on-surface-variant / error (M3 standard roles).
- Typography: body-large / title-large (M3 standard roles).
- Spacing: gap.sm / gap.md / gap.lg.
- ALL token references are by name from the uploaded design system — no hex literals, no inline size values.

## Self-Validation Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before returning the rendered mockup, verify ALL of these are true. If any fails, FIX the output and re-render.

- [ ] **Per-state shape:** the render shows ONLY this state ("error"). Do not blend multiple states into one mockup.
- [ ] **Real content:** every text label, image, and data point reflects the content source manifest above — no numbered generic items, no filler text, no dummy text, no empty strings.
- [ ] **Token fidelity:** colors come from the uploaded design system (primary/secondary/surface/etc.) by name; spacing comes from declared scale tokens. No invented hex codes, no invented size literals.
- [ ] **Component vocabulary:** every component in the render maps to a named design-system component (Card, FAB, BottomBar, etc.) — no invented or off-system components.
- [ ] **Archetype honored:** the layout follows the "dashboard" archetype skeleton — composition order top → bottom matches the Composition section.
- [ ] **App-shell parity:** if a bottom nav, top app bar, or FAB appears in the render, it matches the resolved shell from the app-shell config. Shell elements are either present-and-consistent OR absent — never partial.

If any of these fail and the fix isn't clear → halt rendering and surface "Self-validation failed at: {checkpoint}."

Return ONLY when all 6 checkpoints pass.

Anchored by the retry accent #B2D188, the error state stays restrained and calm, preserving user confidence in the banking context.
